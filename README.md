# Programmer Drills

> [!Important]
> This datapack has been designed exclusively for minecraft `1.21.11`!  
> It will probably work on higher versions, but I make no promises 🙃

A datapack which adds various programmer art styled drills to survival!  
Each drill will automatically dig straight down once powered on (right-clicked) until it reaches a block it cannot break, is broken by a player (left-click), or is broken by the environment (iron drills break in water!).  
To place a drill, simply throw it on the ground!  
Recipes can be found in the recipe book.

Tier | Speed | Hole Size
--- | --- | ---
Iron | 2 blocks per minute | 1x1
Diamond | 2 blocks per minute | 1x1
Netherite | 2 blocks per minute | 1x1
Power | 2 blocks per minute | 3x3

I'm unsure how balanced (or unbalanced) these actually are in game (hence the rather pricey recipes); please send me any feedback via issues!
